**Vehicle Insurance Data Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 

This repository contains code for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on vehicle insurance data. The aim of this project is to provide insights into the customer and policy data of a vehicle insurance company, enabling informed decision-making for future growth and premium discount offers.


**Project Overview** 

A company possesses customer data with various details and another table containing policy details of the customers. The data science team has been tasked with extracting valuable information to offer discounts on premiums to certain customers. The tasks involved in this project are:


Adding column names to both datasets.

Checking and cleaning data quality, including handling null values, outliers, white spaces, case correction, and converting categorical data into dummy variables.

Creating a master table by joining the customer and policy tables.

Extracting important information for decision-making, such as gender-wise and age-wise average annual premiums, balancing data between genders, and analyzing the relationship between person age and annual premium.
